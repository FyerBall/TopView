# Candidates-assignment

This was created using React and CSS.

I created a JSON file and I used filter to filter through categories and used set to store unique values.

I created 2 components

- Categories
  - For the buttons.
- Routes
  - To display the routes.
  - Routes will be displayed based on the category, button clicked.
